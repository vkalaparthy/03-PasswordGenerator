Password Generator

This code generates random passowrd based on user's choice.

User should first click on "Generate Password" button to
start the process.

When user is asked "What is the lenght of the password you want to generate?" 

    - If user chooses anything less than 8 or more than 128, and clicks "OK" user gets an alert message.
    - If user chooses "Cancel", then user gets "Bye Bye!" alert.
    - If user chooses the number between 8 and 128, a series of questions are asked to find the user criteria.

There are 4 choices for password generation, user has to click "OK" to his/her choice of criteria. "Cancel"
to not include certain criteria. Atleast one criteria has to be chosen to continue to generate password.

If the user has not chosen even one criteria, then user gets an alert 
"Try again, You need to choose atleast one criteria!"

Based on the user's choice, the password is generated to include atleast one character from the chosen criteria.

The random password is displayed on the screen.
